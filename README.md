# Android-Mobile-Dev-Tutorials
This repository contains the tutorials that I completed in my 2nd year at IIT for the Mobile Application Development module, which was based on Android Application Development.

The tutorials were based on [Google Codelabs - Android Developer Fundamentals Course](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/)
